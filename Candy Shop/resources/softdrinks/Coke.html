   <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. 
      Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was 
      invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by 
      businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance 
      of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to 
      two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).
