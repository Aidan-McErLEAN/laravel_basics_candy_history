   <p>The Starburst brand was introduced in England in 1959. 
      They were first known as Opal Fruits, the name coming from 
      the result of a competition. The four original flavors were 
      strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. In 1967 Opal Fruits were 
      brought to the United States and the name was changed to Starburst.
