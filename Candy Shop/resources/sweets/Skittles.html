   <p>Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. 
      The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from the sports game of the same name, 
      named as such for the resemblance of the sweet to items used in the game. They 
      were first introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery. In 1982, 
      domestic production of Skittles began in the United States.
