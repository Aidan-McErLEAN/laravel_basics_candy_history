   <p>Frank Mars, founder of Mars, Inc. (originally called Mar-O-Bar Co.), 
      invented the Snickers bar in 1930. The candy bar is named after one of Frank Mars' 
      favorite horses, Snickers. But until 1990, the bar was sold under the name “Marathon” 
      in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, and Ireland.
