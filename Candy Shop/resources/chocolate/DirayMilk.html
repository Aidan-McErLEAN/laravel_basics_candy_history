   <p>Dairy Milk was launched in June 1905. 
      It was sold in unwrapped blocks that could be broken down into penny bars. 
      Gradually it became more and more successful, until it was Cadbury's biggest 
      seller by the beginning of the First World War. By the early 1920s it had taken over 
      the UK market.
