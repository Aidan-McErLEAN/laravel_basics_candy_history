   <p>The name Oreo was first trademarked on March 14th, 1912. Originally, Oreos were sold
      in tins and sold by weight. The very first Oreo was sold to a grocer in New Jersey.
      At first, the Oreo had a wreath around the edge of its design, while the word “Oreo”
      was visible in the centre of each side of the cookie.
